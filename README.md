## 🛠 Adding programs
x16 PRos includes a small set of built-in programs. You can add your own program to the system image and then run it using the load command, specifying the disk sector number where you wrote the program as an argument.

Here's how you can add a program:
```bash
dd if=YourProgram.bin of=disk_img/x16pros.img bs=512 seek=DiskSector conv=notrunc
```

You can read more about the software development process for x16-PRos on the project website:
[x16-PRos web site](https://x16-pros.netlify.app/)

---

## 🛠 Compilation
First, clone the reposytory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PRoX2011/x16-PRos.git
```
To compile the project you will only need NASM. 
Example comand for Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install nasm
```
And finaly:
```bash
chmod +x build-linux.sh
./build-linux.sh
```
---

## 🚀 Launchng

To launch x16 PRos, use emulators such as **QEMU**,**Bochs** or online emulator like [v86](https://copy.sh/v86/). 
Example command for **QEMU**:
```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -fda x16-PRos-disk-image.img
```
You can also try running x16-PRos on a **real PC** (preferably with BIOS, not UEFI)

If you still want to run x16-PRos on a UEFI PC, you will need to enable "CSM support" in your BIOS. It may be called slightly differently.

## ⚙ Running x16-PRos on windows

### Installation Steps

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
winget install nasm
winget install qemu
```

2. Add NASM and QEMU to System Path by running:
```powershell
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files\NASM;C:\Program Files\qemu"
```

3. Reboot your PC for the PATH changes to take effect.

4. Run the build script:
```batch
build-windows.bat
```

**Note**: Make sure to restart your terminal or IDE after modifying the PATH variable.

### Troubleshooting
- If commands are not recognized, verify the installation paths
- Ensure PowerShell was run as Administrator during installation
- Check if PATH was updated correctly by running `echo %PATH%`
